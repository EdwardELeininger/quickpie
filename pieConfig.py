    some helper functions are included, PyAutoGui is nice, but and all, but I like to make things a little more readable.

    p._go() is just pyautogui.moveTo(), but a lot less to type, pass it coordinates just like moveTo.

    p._click() is just pyautogui.click.

    p_find(icon, iconB) is simple function to find an icon on the screen and return the center of it.
